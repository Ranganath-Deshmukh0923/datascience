columbus migration project
natwest ->
sas -> streamsets, informatica
table -> on premise to cloud

as part of migration
1. minimize the time scales
2. 

streamsets:

collector
transformer
transformer for snowflake

sdk allows generation of pipeline across all products
python sdk
allows 
automate create pipeline and all other tasks and deployments


for loop can streamsets do that? 
1.streamsets doesnt have row iterator, we need to use pyspark 
2.sparksql can be used for this analytical functions

how streamsets handle macro variables?
